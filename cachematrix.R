## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing repeatedly.
## This pair of functions cache the inverse of a matrix.

## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object which is 
## a list containing a function to
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of the inverse of the matrix
## 4. get the value of the inverse of the matrix


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        i <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                i <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
        getinverse <- function() i
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinverse = setinverse,
             getinverse = getinverse)

}


## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix"
## returned by makeCacheMatrix. If the inverse has already been calculated
## (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse
## from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        i <- x$getinverse()
        if(!is.null(i)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(i)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        i <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setinverse(i)
        i
}
